# OSC Nodes for UPBGE Logic Nodes

## 1. Introduction

This is a modified version of UPBGE that enhances the **Logic Nodes** addon by adding **Open Sound Control (OSC) nodes**. These nodes allow UPBGE to send, receive, and process OSC messages, making it easier to integrate with external applications such as **PureData, Max/MSP, TouchDesigner, and DAWs**.

These nodes enable real-time communication between UPBGE and external software, allowing for interactive music systems, live performances, and procedural animations controlled via OSC.

## 2. Installation

To install the OSC Nodes:

1. Download this repository.
2. Locate the folder **`/3.6`** inside this repository.
3. Copy and paste the **`/3.6`** folder into your **UPBGE main directory**, overwriting any existing files.

After installation, restart UPBGE and you should see the new OSC nodes available in the **Logic Nodes** editor.

  - `Debug` (Condition) â†’ Prints received messages to the console.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Messages` (Parameter) â†’ Dictionary containing received OSC messages.

#### ðŸ”¹ **OSC Receive Node** (`Receive OSC Message`)

- Extracts a specific OSC message from the serverâ€™s dictionary.
- **Inputs:**
  - `Messages` (Parameter) â†’ Dictionary from `Setup OSC Server`.
  - `OSC Address` (String) â†’ The address to filter.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Received` (Condition) â†’ Triggers when a new message is received.

- **Inputs:**
  - `Condition` (Condition) â†’ Triggers the message.
  - `IP` (String) â†’ Target IP address.
  - `Port` (Integer) â†’ Target port.
  - `OSC Address` (String) â†’ The OSC address to send the message to.
  - `Data` (Parameter) â†’ The value to send.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Done` (Condition) â†’ Activates when the message is sent.

#### ðŸ”¹ **OSC Sequencer Node** (`OSC Sequencer`)

- Records and replays OSC messages over time.
- Useful for live performances and procedural animations.

  - `Stop Recording` (Condition) â†’ Stops recording.
  - `Play` (Condition) â†’ Plays the recorded sequence.
  - `Speed` (Float) â†’ Controls playback speed (default = 1.0).
  - `Max Duration` (Float) â†’ Limits the recording length (default = 5s).
  - `Messages` (Parameter) â†’ Dictionary of received OSC messages.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Recording` (Condition) â†’ True while recording.
  - `Playing` (Condition) â†’ True while playing back.
  - `Finished Playing` (Condition) â†’ Triggers when playback ends.
  - `Message` (Parameter) â†’ Outputs the replayed OSC message.

#### ðŸ”¹ **OSC Filter Node** (`Setup OSC Server`)

- Adds some filtering options for advanced users.
- Changes how the OSC server is initialized and processes messages.
- Can help with performance and address filtering.
- **Inputs:**
  - `Queue Lenght`(Integer) â†’ Length of queue for received messages (default = 100).

  - `Filter Repeats`(Boolean) â†’ Enables filtering of repeated values.
  - `Repeat Threshold`(Float) â†’ Sets the threshold to check for repetions.
  - `Drop Overflow`(Boolean) â†’ Determines whether to block or drop messages when the queue is full.
  - `Address Filter`(String) â†’ Determines which address the server initially subscribes to at the dispatcher level.
  - `Address Filter`(String) â†’ Allows filtering messages by OSC address patterns (including wildcards)
- **Outputs:**
  - `Recording` (Condition) â†’ True while recording.
  - `Playing` (Condition) â†’ True while playing back.
  - `Finished Playing` (Condition) â†’ Triggers when playback ends.
